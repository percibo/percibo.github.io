			<h3>it is worth to talk about one's own unique experience and create basic things impeccable and with meditation</h3>
			<p>A precious human knowledge is hidden in the internet. I learn how to speak spanish, to play piano, to make a cheese and bread, to pick up plants, to develop code using only internet and my exercises.</p>
			<p>Just to read a text is not enough. To practice it is more important.</p>
			<p>It is truly interesting to read from someone who practise it himself.</p>
