			<h3>i was a 'don't tell me what to do' person</h3>
			<p>Now i figured out i shouldn't tell to other people what to do too. I shouldn't criticize other people's actions as an unproductive because at least i don't practise it myself, i know nothing about it. If i don't understand something it doesn't mean it is uncool.</p>
			<h3>a word about immutability in information</h3>
			<p>Video is a great tool, because you can't change it innoticeable. Or you just don't bother youself to cut it in the middle in editor. Even if you fumble words and thougts, they have maximum of their power then they have been said out loud first time as is. Immutability is important because of the maximum of power.</p>
			<p>Video is not my way. Words come into my head as an insight, i feel i can't bear i must write it out in some place reachable to at least one other person. I make mistakes, grammar mistakes, mistakes of discourtesy. My thoughts are raw. I begin polish them. They become more polite, less sharp. I need to stop at some point. More polish leads to less bright.</p>
			<h3>'thank you' means rejection</h3>
			<p>You were asking something from universe. Time needed for make it was passed. Universe is giving it to you now. If you really like a thing or a word and you wanted it earlier, take it and use it as you planned. In a moment of obtaining it remember - whoever made it he did it because he himself wanted to do it.</p>
			<h3>whatever is a perfect name</h3>
			<p>I am whatever indeed. I am whatever someone thinks about me, whatever he can imagine. In any case only my actions matter, not me in flesh or as a fixed stage. That actions aren't in a thin air. They are feasible, possible only after interactions between us. I didn't exist outside of your perception. And vice versa.</p>
			<p>My discovery was possible after my interaction with some particular persons. That was my proof of work. But my conclusion relates all the —Åonsciousnesses i could reach.</p>
			<p>Names are given. People asign a name for their creations, for their projects. People give a name to other people.</p>
			<p>Before our encounter there was nothing to offer as a name.</p>
