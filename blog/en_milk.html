			<h3>nutritious and clean milk</h3>
			<p>It is hard to keep milk clean, because it is liquid, and a lot of creatures wanna eat it and live in it. Being in big quantities milk is voluminous and heavy. I know it because i have been making cheese one winter. I had bought home milk from different sellers - sometimes it was literally dirty. But always full of nutrients. Milk from big factories is clean and even tasty, but almost empty as an information source. And you can never make a cheese from factory milk, it is too processed.</p>
			<p>But! I find a good local milk. Here is a <a href = "/blog/en_buymilk.html">home manufacturer</a> who can make it clean and tasty. I have been watching lots of offers from sellers in internet, and i extract an ideal offer for me as a customer - with maximum information in a situation of uncertainty. That page is my prototype of an offer.</p>
			<p>Food is an information. I discover it after eating fresh fruits only for many days, shankha prakshalana and after a days without food at all.</p>
			<p>Of course food has to be safe to eat, but also it should give you a boost to be happy and an energy to make your wiz biz.</p>
