			<h3>how this site was born, ideas and philosophy behind it</h3>
			<p>I was trying to submit one app into some app listings. But to no avail. They didn't publish it neither answer me why it cannot be submitted. So i desided to make my own listing, based on my experience. First things first, I bought this stuff myself spending my own money, creators didn't pay me. I am familiar with those creations, i just use it in my everyday human life - i eat food, wear dresses, travel, speak, think.</p>
			<p>The second reason of this site's existence is my discovery: 'thank you' means rejection. So, that was something unexpectedly bigger and really cool, i cannot just say "thank you".</p>
			<p>In this site i use the languages i speak. I don't translate texts literally. Thoughts were born in my head in different languages and were written on as is.</p>
			<p>Every line of this site html and javascript including is made from scratch nearly in a text editor. It leads me to a full control of what is going on in here. All is simple in here yet i can change absolutely everything. So, i am the god of percibo.</p>
			<p>It is worth to write about something what i like, what exists and towards what i go. What is clean. </p>
			<p>A tip: you don't need a site or other human things to perceive the nature. Just go outside with whatever you have right now on hand, even naked, and enjoy the weather, birds, the wind and the sun and whatever you can catch using your perception.</p>
			<p>When i perceive the world world is changing me. When i describe it i change the world.</p>
