			<h3>prequel: abstract</h3>
			<p>Human attention costs. Because every human has a piece of sun inside. He begins to look at something, learn it, perceive it. And that thing begins to grow. By choosing what we like we move the world to some direction, change it.</p>
			<p>Money is a good tool for human interactions - without feeling obliged and incompleteness. We will be balanced immediately. You create something by meditating. I like it. I know how to apply it as a next step in my life. So i pay for it. We can part ways feeling happy and as a winner, both of us.</p>
			<p>We need to manifestate our brain as we want to drink, to eat, to exercise body every day. Create things by hands, create thoughts. Share them to other people. I am the god in my universe. But sometimes - only sometimes - i need other humans to exercise my human skills.</p>
			<p>I am very glad to meet you. You is a someone who is reading it right now. Because you've find it somehow and are getting through my thoughts. I was thinking i am a single person in one planet. And suddenly i discover other people from other planets. All of us are self-sufficient and big enough. And those people are as strong and complex as i need to improve my human experience.</p>
			<p>Even if it is over and nothing new is gonna happen. Anyways.</p>
			<p>These days changed my whole life. </p>
			<p>I like it!</p>
			<p>What makes you happy makes me happy too.</p>
