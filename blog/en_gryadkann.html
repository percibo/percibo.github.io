			<h3>how to live in a big city with one's own garden, where are macadamia, wonderful kiwi and other vegetation year-round</h3>
			<p><a rel = "noopener" target="_blank" href="http://грядканн.рф/">Gryadkann</a> is a first online store where is possible to buy boxes of fruits and vegetables - starting from one box per order. Why is it unique and convenient?</p>
			<p>It has the best delivery system - 3 hours interval, i can plan my day before it and after it. We can clarify content of order and delivery time using only messengers and text - without voice calls.  I am notified about delivery exact time through text - 20-30 minutes before delivery.</p>
			<p>The quality of fruits, veggies, nuts - they are alive and with an interesting taste.</p>
			<p>Fruits are packed in wooden or carton boxes by manufacturer. So there is no intermediaries. Fruits are protected from damage as much as possible. But don't forget they are alive, so couple of fruits starting to spoil can be found in there, but not in every case.</p>
			<p>One box is enough for up to half a month and can be stored fine in a regular fridge. I have got a box of pears from South America, they lasted exactly half a month. It saves me a lot of time and energy - instead of going to the shop i do my things - i ride a bicycle, enjoy the summer, think and write this site.</p>

			<p>This is my previous order with sweet cherry. Simple wrapping is just good for a transportation. I pay for a fruit and nut itself, not for a printed texts and pictures.</p>
			<p>A creator of this project has wrote he wanted to build a good and beneficial service for people. For me - it is already done, 100%.</p>
